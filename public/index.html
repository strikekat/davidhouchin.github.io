      <p>Around a year ago or so, I tackled getting Visual Pinball running under Linux. After a lot of tweaks and debugging, I was able to eventually get pretty good results which is mostly documented there.
After finally reinstalling a fresh copy of Fedora 33 a couple weeks ago, I setup VPX again and found that things seem to be even simpler than before.
Assumptions:
 You have Steam and the Proton 5.</p>

      <p>I finally got the old posts from my old Wordpress site re-uploaded here. There&rsquo;s some technical data that I didn&rsquo;t want to see lost (Although I believe Wayback Machine still archived everything).
This was much more tricky than I thought. I backed up the entire site with UpdraftPlus.
However, while everything was backed up in some way or another, the actual textual content was saved as a MySQL dump, escape characters and all.</p>

Running MAME A few days ago, I decided to go ahead and update the MAME setup on my machine. I have a mostly-working MAME cabinet in the arcade, but it still needs some work on the controls and display, not to mention it&rsquo;s not exactly portable.</p>

Background Most pinball machines manufactured have a &ldquo;killer feature&rdquo;. While there is absolutely a collection of standard features that have been ubiquitous on nearly every machine, almost every game has tried to offer a unique design element of it&rsquo;s very own. Terminator 2 has it&rsquo;s rotating cannon, Black Knight has the magna-save, and Medieval Madness has it&rsquo;s crumbling castle.</p>

This last weekend, we visited the Northwest Pinball and Arcade Show for a little bit. We had a great time, played a ton of games I haven&rsquo;t touched until now, and got to meet and grab a picture with Steve Ritchie (Out of my games, designer of Terminator 2, and the voice in Space Shuttle)!</p>

Background Just a few days ago, I received Terminator 2. This machine is awesome! Talk about a powerhouse packed with great sounds and visuals, alongside easy-to-pick-up gameplay and an instantly recognizable theme.
A quick trip down T2&rsquo;s history - This machine was released in 1991 and designed by Steve Ritchie, who has designed several other excellent games at Williams (Black Knight, Firepower, F-14, Star Trek: TNG, etc).</p>

      <p>Welcome to my new site. I&rsquo;ve decided for a while that I should probably move away from WordPress and server-side websites for a while. Moreso for ease-of-hosting and my sanity than anything else. I also decided that I should distill the site a little more to my hobbies only.
I created this with Hugo, mainly because it seemed very fast (it is) and is written in Go. I haven&rsquo;t been disappointed so far.</p>
