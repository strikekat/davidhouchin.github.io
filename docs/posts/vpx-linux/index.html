    <h4 id="update">Update</h4>
<p>This guide is fairly out of date and rudimentary. I am hoping to have an updated version on here at some point that does things in a better and more sandboxed way.</p>
<p>Unfortunately since VPX 10.7, I&rsquo;ve personally found VPX to overall be much less stable under Wine with a much higher chance of crashing. Luckily this doesn&rsquo;t seem to happen during actual gameplay, but frequently for me within the editor, loading a new table, and opening the in-game menu.</p>
<p>I think the only real solution for us non-Windows user will eventually be the Visual Pinball Engine, but until then, I hold out hope we can make the situation with VPX a little better - whether that&rsquo;s a launcher, handy scripts, etc.. (also VPX is probably the thing I&rsquo;m most excited to throw on my eventual Steam Deck :))</p>
<h4 id="original">Original</h4>
<p>Around a year ago or so, I tackled getting <a href="https://vpinball.com/forums/topic/visual-pinballx-on-linux/">Visual Pinball running under Linux</a>. After a <em>lot</em> of tweaks and debugging, I was able to eventually get pretty good results which is mostly documented there.<br>
After finally reinstalling a fresh copy of Fedora 33 a couple weeks ago, I setup VPX again and found that things seem to be even simpler than before.</p>
<p>Assumptions:</p>
<ul>
<li>You have Steam and the Proton 5.13 runtime installed. You can run any game and force compatibility to Proton 5.13 to download it. (You could use regular Wine + DXVK without Steam, but it&rsquo;ll likely need a few different dependencies)</li>
<li>You are running a fairly vanilla install of VPX. I have not tried custom VPinMAME builds, external DMDs, etc.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="setup">Setup</h2>
<ol>
<li>Install the <code>winetricks</code> package for your distro.</li>
<li>Create a directory to hold your VPX install. In this folder, create a <code>prefix</code> directory.</li>
<li>Download the VPX installer for 10.6 and place in the VPX directory.</li>
<li>Create a <code>run.sh</code> script with these contents (Replace your directories as needed):</li>
</ol>

<span style="color:#4e4e4e">#wine VPinballX.exe</span>
</code></pre></div><ol start="5">
<li>Run the script and go through each setup.</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>For VPX, I installed to the ~/games directory (Z drive to Wine) so that I had quick access to the files but you can install purely inside the prefix (C:/) or elsewhere.</li>
<li>The DirectX setup will error out and .Net will report as already installed, this is expected.</li>
</ul>
<ol start="6">
<li>Once all the setups have completed, you can delete/comment the 3 wine/winetricks lines and uncomment the last line. I also run it with <code>gamemoderun</code> but I didn&rsquo;t personally notice any performance improvements.</li>
</ol>
<p>If all went well, you should be able to start a table now with ROM included and play without issue.</p>
<h2 id="configuration">Configuration</h2>
<p>Out of the box, most settings should work as-is. A benefit of Proton is allowing you to run fullscreen-exclusive resolutions without actually changing your display resolution (Something that does not happen smoothly with X11).</p>
<p>One setting you may need to disable is &ldquo;Reflect Dynamic Elements on Playfield&rdquo;, which caused numerous visual artifacts for me.</p>
<h2 id="issues">Issues</h2>
<ul>
<li>Pressing Escape in-game seems to cause most tables to just crash VPX completely instead of bringing up the little menu. This did <em>not</em> happen previously for me until this new install.</li>
<li>A couple tables do exhibit issues that don&rsquo;t appear on Windows. Namely Guns n Roses has several elements display in pure black, and g5k&rsquo;s Firepower has absolutely awful performance. Vast majority of tables I opened worked fine.</li>
<li>I have not tried DirectB2S under Linux and can&rsquo;t comment on that yet. I have DirectB2S disabled in the settings but there&rsquo;s an occasional table that seems to demand using B2S as the controller (So will not start).</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>I will continue to tweak this as I work through a huge backlog of VPX tables released over the past several months.<br>
I think virtual pinball on Linux is vastly underrepresented. Maybe we could get a launcher/install script or something thrown together?</p>
